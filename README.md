# Java Data Types: int, long, float, double

Java is a statically typed language, which means that every variable must be declared with a data type. The four primary numeric data types in Java are `int`, `long`, `float`, and `double`. Each type has its own range and precision, making it suitable for different scenarios.

## 1. int

- **Description**: The `int` data type is a 32-bit signed integer.
- **Range**: From -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647.
- **Usage**: Used when you need to store whole numbers without decimals.
- **Example**:
  ```java
  int number = 100;

 ### 3. float
Description: The float data type is a single-precision 32-bit IEEE 754 floating point.
Range: Approximately ±3.40282347E+38 (6-7 significant decimal digits).
Usage: Used for saving memory in large arrays of floating-point numbers. It's less precise than double.


 ### 4. double
Description: The double data type is a double-precision 64-bit IEEE 754 floating point.
Range: Approximately ±1.79769313486231570E+308 (15 significant decimal digits).
Usage: Used for decimal values when more precision is needed.
Example:
```java
double preciseNumber = 19.99;


Summary
Data Type	Size (bits)	Range	Precision
int	32	-2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647	6-7 decimal digits
long	64	-9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807	15 decimal digits
float	32	±3.40282347E+38	6-7 decimal digits
double	64	±1.79769313486231570E+308	15 decimal digits
Understanding these data types is crucial for effective programming in Java, as they impact memory usage and performance.
